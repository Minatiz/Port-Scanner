# Port Scanner

My own work on Port Scanner using templates from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/information-security/information-security-projects/port-scanner)

Run port_scanner.py, experiment under def main().
Test modules completed and success. Had to remove some whitespaces due to different style.
